- This project is my first project using react 18 for frontend and laravel 10 for backend...
- Languages uses
       - HTML CSS BOOTSTRAP JQUERY REACT SASS LARAVEL 
- This project has two main parts..
- They are User section and Admin session..
- I used React for User Session and Laravel for Admin Session..
- User must log in and admin also log in because each session has different exist url route..
- For user , If user is not logged in, user can search , view products and visit routes and if user is logged in user can search , view products and visit routes and also cart using and order with user's like..
- For admin , Admin must log in if not admin is not used. so admin can insert products , view messages from user and arrange the order for each user
- Must be careful things
       - Don't open the file without internet
       - You can't log in user sesson and admin session at once . (if logged in as a user, don't log in as a admin without logging out as a user and also for reverse..)
- I used jwt token for user and laravel session for admin. ( adjust refresh token )
